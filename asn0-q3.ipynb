    "In this question we'll learn some more ways to manipulate images and display the results using what we learned in questions 1 and 2.  In particular we'll use slicing of numpy arrays to extract parts of an image and use logical indexing of numpy arrays to select pixels of an image, and change their values.  Slicing and logical indexing are covered in the CMPT 141 textbook in section 13.3.3 and 13.3.7 respectively.\n",
